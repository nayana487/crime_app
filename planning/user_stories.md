Charm City Blotter

Charm City Blotter is a space where Baltimore residents and the local media can keep each other informed about suspected criminal activity in the area. Members of the public can write posts and comments, but verified reporters will confirm whether or not the accounts are accurate. Reporters also maintain the right to delete material that may be considered inflammatory. If this occurs, we will leave a note explaining the decision.

1. As a user, I want to be able to write posts about criminal incidents I observe in the city.
2. As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete those posts.
3. As a user, I want to select geographical regions in the city to view a list
of incidents in that area.
4. As a user, I want to be able to view a specific incident.
5. As a user, I want to be able to comment on incidents.
6. As a user, I want to be able to delete comments. (As an admin user, I don't want public users to be able to edit comments because it would get complicated trying to track that. Noticed it's set up this way on other news blog sites.)
7. As an admin user (reporter), I want to be able to delete all posts and comments so as not to leave inflammatory material up on the site.
